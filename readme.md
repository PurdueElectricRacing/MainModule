Check out doc_code/Project/src/waveplayer.c for useful source code. This is the most relevant code to our project.
Ignore any other tutorials you might find online, they are useless (I have tried them). 

See this link for the documentation for the soruce code:

Essentially the last steps to this project are modifying the example code (which is much more complex than we need) to play a
single audio file from an sd card. Don't worry too much about the "reading sd card" part, that is existing code in our repos.

Slack me @ Tyler Marchok with any other questions.
